# Audio Classifier for Idling Engine Sounds

## Setup
This project requires Python 3 and the following packages:
```
pandas
librosa
glob
matplotlib
numpy
scipy
keras
tensorflow
```

NB The Training Set used is not included in this repository due to the large file size, however it can be downloaded for free from:
https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-urban-sound-classification/

## Load and Plot Waveform

- The file ```Plot_Audio_Data.py``` can be used to show a plot of the waveform for sounds in the training set. The plot below shows the waveform for an Idling Engine recording.
